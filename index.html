    <p>While I have made many wonderful websites and web apps in my time sadly this is not one of them. It is merely a notice to advertise two facts:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>That I make websites.</li>
        <li>That I make open source software.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If you are interested in my work please see my <a href="https://github.com/D1plo1d">github profile</a>.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, I have recently posted <a href="http://imgur.com/a/SFQtn">some screen shots</a> of a current <a href="github.com/D1plo1d/ctrlpanel">open source project</a> of mine to imgur. You are of course welcome to take a quick through these as well.</p>

    <p>Finally I have <a href="http://d1plo1d.github.com/p3d/examples/">an example of loading 3D CAD files into the web browser</a> I put together to demonstrate <a href="github.com/D1plo1d/p3d">a coffeescript library</a> that I wrote for that purpose.</p>
